# gasGrill object

This object has the following properties:
- brand (String): The brand or manufacturer of the gas grill.
- model (String): The model name or number of the gas grill.
- color (String): The color of the gas grill.
- price (Number): The price of the gas grill.
- isPortable (Boolean): Indicates whether the gas grill is portable (true) or not (false).
- features (Array): An array of strings representing the features of the gas grill.
- ignition (Function): A method that toggles the ignition state of the gas grill.

In this code, the gasGrill object is created with various properties such as brand, model, color, price, isPortable, features, and ignition. The ignition method is a function that toggles the isIgnited property of the gas grill.

The code then logs the gasGrill object to the console, displaying its current state, and triggers the ignition method by calling gasGrill.ignition(), demonstrating the ability to toggle the ignition state of the gas grill.
